# house_value_estimator

### About:
in this project I collected the data from "Immonet" platform (one of the biggest real estate platfroms in Germany) and after cleaning and preparing the data I built machine learning model to predict houses price.

### Files:

#### 1- scraping:
I used BeatifulSoup library to scrape the data from immonet and i applied multi-threading technique to reduce the processing time.

#### 2- model:
clean and prepare the data and build a machine learning model using Decision Tree algorithm.

#### 3- houses:
a scv file contains the scrapped data from the website.


#### Note:
some features and values in the dataset are in German language.
